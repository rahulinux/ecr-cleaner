    description: The ECR Image Cleanup Tool addresses limitations in Amazon ECR's
      built-in lifecycle policies, particularly for multi-architecture images. It
      helps prevent repositories from hitting the 10,000 image hard limit imposed
      by ECR by providing more flexible and architecture-aware cleanup options.
